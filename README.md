Updating the Bondtech CR10s5 BL-Touch... or at least trying to
We jst installed a bigger heating bed with the Bondtech and I'm getting into the firm software right now. Trying to run the Z-probe didn't work quiet well... And the next project, once I've finished this little thingy will be the filament sensor. ;-)
I always want to know more and, for particular, understand what I am doing and not just do it to hope, it will work. Getting started.
